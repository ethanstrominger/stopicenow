    <h1>FixICE.org</h1>
    <p><strong>A simple place to find ways to act—without getting overwhelmed.</strong></p>
    <p>Many people want to respond to ICE, deportations, and related policies—but the amount of information,
      organizations, and actions can feel overwhelming. <strong>. This website was created to make it easier to find <em>one</em>
        meaningful thing you can do.</strong></p>
    <p>This site curates actions into a few clear categories, so you can choose what fits your energy, time, and comfort
      level:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Protest</strong> – show up in person</li>
      <li><strong>Advocate</strong> – make calls, send postcards, take quick actions</li>
      <li><strong>Volunteer</strong> – support organizations doing sustained work</li>
      <li><strong>Donate</strong> – fund effective efforts</li>
      <li><strong>Boycott</strong> – apply economic pressure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each section is intentionally limited to <strong>one page</strong>, with links to trusted groups and concrete
      actions.</p>

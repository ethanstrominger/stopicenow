  <h1>U.S. Citizen Killed by ICE on Jan 7</h1>

  <p>
    On January 7, 2026, a 37‑year-old U.S. citizen was fatally shot by an Immigration and
    Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis during a federal immigration enforcement action.
    Federal authorities have characterized the incident as self-defense and an act of "terrorism", but the video footage released by 
    ABC News shows the individual was unarmed and posed no threat.  
  </p>
  <p>32 people died in 2025 due to ICE actions.  75% of people detained by ICE had no criminal record or criminal record and 18% had only minor offenses, such as a traffic violatioon.
  </p>
  <p>I.C.E. arrests people without a warrant or due process, often ignoring proof of legal status.  
    It can be days before a detainee is allowed to contact a legal represtantive and family's are 
    not notified of the arrest.  Detainees are often held in poor conditions, with inadequate access to medical care, food, and sanitation.
    In Burlington, MA, there are 35 people housed per room, with no access to windows, no sanitary facilities,
    must sleep on concrete floors, and must go to the bathroom in buckets.  These conditions are typical for 
    detention centers around the country.  These are some of the worst conditions in the world.
  </p>
  <h2>This must stop!  Please join the movement to end ICE violence and support immigrant rights.</h2>

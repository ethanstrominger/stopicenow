  <h1>U.S. Citizen Murdered by ICE on Jan 7</h1>

  <p>
    On January 7, 2026, a 37‑year-old U.S. citizen was fatally shot by an Immigration and
    Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis during a federal immigration enforcement action.
    Federal authorities have characterized the incident as self-defense, but local officials —
    including Mayor Jacob Frey — have condemned the killing as reckless and unnecessary,
    sparking protest and outrage in the Twin Cities and beyond.

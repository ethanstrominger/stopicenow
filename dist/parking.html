    <h1>Parking for District Ave Protests</h1>
    <p>For current towing risks and safe alternatives see the parking info on this <a
        href="hhttps://bearingwitnessne.org/the-standout">Bearing Witness web page</a>.
      Cars have been towed and the ticket may cost $180 or more. If you want to park
      closer there are things you can do to lower your risk. You can drop off any protest signs at 1000
      District Ave on Wed, Thu, and Friday.  For Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday protests you can drop off signs at 
      the corner of District Ave and Burlington Mall Road.  Do not drop off signs if no one is around.
    </p>
    <p>Consider Kohl's or the strip mall at the end of District Ave with Just Salad.
     Unlike Burlington Mall and District Ave, they
    do not have security patrols and they have not announced they would tow.
  The strip mall feels safer because it is so busy and
  any one shop can't tell if you are going into another shop.
</p>
    <p>Burlington Mall and District Ave area
      have security patrols that look for people exiting a car with a sign or people walking directly from the car to
      the
      protest.  
      If you do not carry a visible sign and you walk into Pressed Cafe it would be very difficult for them
      to identify you as a protestor and identify your car.</p>
